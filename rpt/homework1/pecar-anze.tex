\title{Homework \#1: Human Mitochondrion}

\section{Introduction}

In the first homework we analyse the human mitochondrial DNA sequence.   

\section{Data}

Data was obtained from GenBank and is given in FASTA format. In FASTA nucleotides are represented using single letter codes (A, T, C and G). FASTA format defines many other letters of which only the letter N was present in our data. N can represent aNy nucleotide, but because there was only one such occurrence, we simply ignore it.

\section*{Honor Code}

% The following paragraph of your report should be included as is - do % not change it.

My answers to homework are my own work. I did not make solutions or code available to anyone else. I did not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve my results or dishonestly improve/hurt the results of others.
