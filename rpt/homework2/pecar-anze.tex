\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

In the second homework we analyse the genomic sequence of \textit{Paramecium tetraurelia}.

\section{Data}

Data was obtained from GenBank \textit{Nucleotide NC\_006058.1}. This time we were interested in protein coding genes. In the GenBank database this relates to CDS feature type.

\section{Methods}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Detecting open reading frames (ORFs)}

5081 ORFs code for at least 60 amino acids.

\subsection{Precision and recall}

\subsection{Precision and recall for 125 codons or more}
0.1026 precision, 0.4017 recall

\section*{Honor Code}

% The following paragraph of your report should be included as is - do % not change it.

My answers to homework are my own work. I did not make solutions or code available to anyone else. I did not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve my results or dishonestly improve/hurt the results of others.
